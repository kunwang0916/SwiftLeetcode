/**
 814. Binary Tree Pruning
 https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-pruning/description/
 
 We are given the head node root of a binary tree, where additionally every node's value is either a 0 or a 1.
 
 Return the same tree where every subtree (of the given tree) not containing a 1 has been removed.
 
 (Recall that the subtree of a node X is X, plus every node that is a descendant of X.)
 
 Example 1:
 Input: [1,null,0,0,1]
 Output: [1,null,0,null,1]
 
 Explanation:
 Only the red nodes satisfy the property "every subtree not containing a 1".
 The diagram on the right represents the answer.
 
 
 Example 2:
 Input: [1,0,1,0,0,0,1]
 Output: [1,null,1,null,1]
 
 Example 3:
 Input: [1,1,0,1,1,0,1,0]
 Output: [1,1,0,1,1,null,1]
 
 Note:
 
 The binary tree will have at most 100 nodes.
 The value of each node will only be 0 or 1.
