 https://leetcode.com/problems/jewels-and-stones/description/
 
 You're given strings J representing the types of stones that are jewels, and S representing the stones you have.
 Each character in S is a type of stone you have.  You want to know how many of the stones you have are also jewels.
 
 The letters in J are guaranteed distinct, and all characters in J and S are letters. Letters are case sensitive,
 so "a" is considered a different type of stone from "A".
 
 - Example 1:
 
 Input: J = "aA", S = "aAAbbbb"
 Output: 3
 
 - Example 2:
 
 Input: J = "z", S = "ZZ"
 Output: 0

        var result = 0
        for char in S {
            if J.contains(char) {
                result += 1
            }
        }
        return result
